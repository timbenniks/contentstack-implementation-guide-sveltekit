# Contentstack SDK implemenation guide: Sveltekit

This is a bare-bones example to connect Sveltekit to Contentstack.
This example covers the following items:

- SDK initialization
- live preview setup

## How to get started

Before you can run this code, you will need a Contentstack "Stack" to connect to.
Follow the following steps to seed a Stack that this codebase understands.

### Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g @contentstack/cli
```

### Log in via the CLI

```bash
csdx auth:login
```

### Get your organization UID

In your Contentstack Organization dashboard find `Org admin` and copy your Organization ID (Example: `blt481c598b0d8352d9`).

### Create a new stack

Make sure to replace `<YOUR_ORG_ID>` with your actual Organization ID and run the below.

```bash
csdx cm:stacks:seed --repo "timbenniks/contentstack-implementation-guides-seed" --org "<YOUR_ORG_ID>" -n "Implementation Guide"
```

### Create a new delivery token.

Go to Settings > Tokens and create a delivery token. Select the `preview` scope and turn on `Create preview token`

> In the case of Sveltekit, check the settings in the environment and make sure the url is: `http://localhost:5173/` instead of `http://localhost:3000/`

### Fill out your .env file.

Now that you have a delivery token, you can fill out the .env file in your codebase.

```
VITE_CONTENTSTACK_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
VITE_CONTENTSTACK_DELIVERY_TOKEN=<YOUR_DELIVERY_TOKEN>
VITE_CONTENTSTACK_PREVIEW_TOKEN=<YOUR_PREVIEW_TOKEN>
VITE_CONTENTSTACK_REGION=<YOUR_REGION>
VITE_CONTENTSTACK_ENVIRONMENT=preview
VITE_CONTENTSTACK_PREVIEW=true
```

### Turn on Live Preview

Go to Settings > Live Preview. Click enable and select the `Preview` environment in the drop down. Hit save.

### Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run your app

```bash
npm run start
```

### See your page in live preview mode

Go to Entries and select the only entry in the list.
In the sidebar, click on the live preview icon.
